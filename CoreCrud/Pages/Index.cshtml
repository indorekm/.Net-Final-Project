    <p>The history of watches began in 16th century Europe, where watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, 
        which first appeared in the 15th century. The watch which developed from the 16th century to the mid 20th century 
        was a mechanical device, powered by winding a mainspring which turned gears and then moved the hands, and kept time with 
        a rotating balance wheel. The invention of the quartz watch in the 1960s, which ran on electricity and kept time with a vibrating 
        quartz crystal, proved a radical departure for the industry. During the 1980s quartz watches took over the market from mechanical 
        watches, an event referred to as the <strong>"quartz crisis"</strong>. Although mechanical watches still sell at the high end of the market, 
        the vast majority of watches now have quartz movements.</p>
